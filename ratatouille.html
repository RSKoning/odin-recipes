                            Eggplant:
                        </b>
                        Eggplant is one of the main ingredients in Classic French Ratatouille. It’s commonly believed that eggplant must always be salted before cooking to draw out the bitterness. 
                        However, eggplant characteristically has a mild but pleasing bitterness so it’s a personal preference. It’s only when an eggplant gets large and seedy that it develops a pronounced bitter flavor. For this dish, I do salt the eggplant because it won’t absorb as much oil when cooked. Extracting liquid from the eggplant makes it less spongy, resulting in less oil absorption. After draining and before cooking, pat dry with paper towels to remove the excess moisture and salt.

                            Bellpepers:
                        </b>
                        Use any sweet bell pepper or combination:  Red, Yellow or Orange.
                    </p>

                            Dry White Wine:
                        </b>
                        Always use a wine you would enjoy drinking. If you don’t wish to use alcohol, use vegetable broth or even water. Add 1-2 teaspoons of white wine vinegar.

                            Crushed Tomatoes:
                        </b>
                        Use canned crushed tomatoes, whole tomatoes that you crush yourself or a fresh tomato sauce such as my Parma-Style Tomato Sauce.

                            Seasonings:
                        </b>
                        Even though Ratatouille is all about summer freshness, I use dried oregano because the flavor is concentrated and is released as the stew simmers.  Fresh herbs are always best added near the end of the cooking process but I didn’t want fresh oregano and fresh basil competing with one another.

                        Gather and measure all the ingredients. The French call this mise en place or “everything in its place” which refers to the set-up before cooking.

                        Cube the eggplant, place it in a colander and generously salt with a teaspoon or so of salt.

                        Pat the eggplant dry with a paper towel. Heat some of the olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the eggplant, reduce to medium heat and brown the eggplant.  Transfer it to a bowl.

                        Refresh the oil if needed then add the zucchini and yellow squash.  Cook until it begins to brown and soften a bit.  Transfer to the bowl with the eggplant.

                        Refresh the oil again if needed.  Toss in the onion and cook until it begins to soften then add the bell peppers.  Cook that a bit until it softens up then add the garlic and give it a stir until it’s fragrant.

                        Add the crushed tomatoes, bay leaf, dried oregano and crushed red pepper flakes.
